# Releasing

In order to release the SDK on Maven Central, do the following.

1. Change all the SDK artifacts version to `X.Y.Z` where it previously was `X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT`:
   from the root of the repository invoke
   ```
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$VERSION
   ```
   where `$VERSION` is in the following format: `X.Y.Z`.
   This should set the desired version in the various [pom.xml](pom.xml) files, including
   the [pom.xml](concordium-sdk/pom.xml) in [concordium-sdk](concordium-sdk) and
   the [pom.xml](concordium-android-sdk/pom.xml) in [concordium-android-sdk/](concordium-android-sdk)
2. Update the Changelog
3. Commit the version and changelog update
4. Tag the commit in the following format: `v.X.Y.Z`
5. Manually trigger the `Release` workflow for the tag.
   [Ask for approval](https://github.com/orgs/Concordium/teams/java-sdk-publishers) for the last part of the workflow
6. Change all the SDK artifacts version to `SNAPSHOT` for further development:
   from the root of the repository invoke
   ```
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$VERSION-SNAPSHOT
   ```
   where `$VERSION` is the just released version.
   This should set the desired version in the various [pom.xml](pom.xml) files, including
   the [pom.xml](concordium-sdk/pom.xml) in [concordium-sdk](concordium-sdk) and
   the [pom.xml](concordium-android-sdk/pom.xml) in [concordium-android-sdk/](concordium-android-sdk)
7. Commit the version update
8. Merge (squash) the release branch into `main`
9. Sign in to https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/ (credentials can be found in Bitwarden)
10. In the Build Promotion menu in the left select the Staging Repositories item
11. Select the Concordium repository
12. "Close" the selected repository to prepare it for release
13. Once the closing is complete, "Release" it
14. Wait for the version to appear under https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/concordium/sdk/
15. Manually add Changelog entries of this version to the GitHub release,
    which was automatically created by the `Release` workflow

The released artifacts must become available here:

- [java sdk](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.concordium.sdk/concordium-sdk)
- [android archive](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.concordium.sdk/concordium-android-sdk)

## Javadoc

The `Relase` workflow also creates the branch `javadoc` if it does not already exist.
This branch contains the generated javadoc which is visible
at: [https://concordium.github.io/concordium-java-sdk/javadoc/concordium-sdk/apidocs/](https://concordium.github.io/concordium-java-sdk/javadoc/concordium-sdk/apidocs/)

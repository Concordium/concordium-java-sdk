# Wallet example for Android applications

This folder contains a small project for an Android app that uses the Concordium Android SDK.

For the app to build with a pre-release SDK version, run `mvn install` in the parent folder first.

The app is able to take a BIP39 seed phrase, and use that to create/recover an identity, create an account and send transfers using the created account.
